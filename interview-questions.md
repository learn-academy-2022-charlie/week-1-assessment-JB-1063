# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
Git is a software called Global Interface Technology used in the Github site. Github is the website using the git software.
  Researched answer: The git software is used mainly for tracking changes in files. The git software helps progammers coordinate work when they are collaborating to develop source codes.
      The Github is a repository that is cloud based, uses git software that hosts files or project for developers.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

The following operators will return a Boolean value:

    =  - the equals sign
    <  - the less than sign
    >  - the more than sign
  Researched answer: In addition to the above operators, the following operators will return Boolean value:
          * &&  - And relational operator
          * ||  - Not, another relational operator
          
          Sometimes these operators are also used in combination with one another to further narrow down some conditions.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
An index in an array tells us the location, like an address. The index will tell us the location, while the value tells us what is in that location. If If I will equate it to a mail address, the value is like the name that resides in it while the index is the address which points to the exact location.
  Researched answer: In an array, an index is a specific location where a value is stored. Value is the item of value stored  in the location pointed to by the index. A value must be a data type that the Javascript accepts.



4. What is iteration? 
  Your answer: Doing a set of operations or functions multiple times.

  Researched answer: Repeating execution of codes until set stopping condition is met. It is very usefull in handling large data. These large amounts of data are usually in string or arrays.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
In pair programing there is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the one typing the code while the navigator tells the driver what to type.
  Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique where two people  work in tandem to design, code and test the code. They often switch roles between driving and navigating. The Navigator steers the direction of the code while the driver is completing the task at hand. This technique has the advantage of helping to lower the number of defects in the code.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:  This function usually takes a function as an argument and may also output and argument. Usually found in arrays and other high data objects. Some examples are .map() and .filter.

2. Jest: A testing method to verify correctness of code syntax.

3. Objects: A javascript datatype.

4. Method: Objects with functions are called methods.

5. Classes: A type function that contains both data and behavior.
